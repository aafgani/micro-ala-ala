✅ Before running docker-compose, make sure init.sh is executable to avoid the "Permission denied" error:
chmod +x infrastructure/pg-init-scripts/init.sql

✅ After docker-compose runs successfully, you can connect to the containerized SQL Server using your preferred tool (e.g., Azure Data Studio or SSMS):

Server: localhost,5432 (db : mydatabase)
Username: postgres
Password: (find the value in docker compose file)
