✅ Before running docker-compose, make sure init.sh is executable to avoid the "Permission denied" error:
chmod +x infrastructure/sql-scripts/init.sh

✅ After docker-compose runs successfully, you can connect to the containerized SQL Server using your preferred tool (e.g., Azure Data Studio or SSMS):

Server: 127.0.0.1,1433 (sample todo-db)
Username: sa
Password: (Check the .env file for the value of SA_PASSWORD)
